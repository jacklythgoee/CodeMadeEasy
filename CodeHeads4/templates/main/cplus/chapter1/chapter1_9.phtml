                    <h2>Literals</h2>
                    <p>
                        Consider the following statements:
                    </p>
                        <pre>
                            <code class="language-cpp line-numbers">
                                std::cout << "Hello World!";
                                int x { 5 };
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                    <p>
                        The above statements are <b>literals</b>. A literal is a fixed value that has been directly inserted into the source code. 
                        Literals and variables both have a value and type. However, the value of a literal is fixed and cannot be changed, 
                        whereas the value of a variable can be changed through initialization and assignment.

                    <h2>Operators</h2>
                    <p>
                        In mathematics, an <b>operation</b> is a mathematical calculation involving zero or more input values (called <b>operands</b>) 
                        that produces a new output value. The specific operation to be performed is denoted by a construct (typically 
                        a symbol or pair of symbols) called an <b>operator</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You are likely familiar with standard arithmetic operators from common usage in mathematics, including addition, 
                        subtraction, multiplication, and division. In C++, assignment (=) is an operator as well as are insertion (<<) and extraction (>>). 
                        Some operators use more than one symbol, such as the equality operator (==), which allows us to compare two values to see if they are equal. 
                        There are also several operators that are words (new, delete, throw).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The number of operands than an operator takes as input is called the operators arity. Operators in C++ have three different arities:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Unary</b> - These operators act on one operand. <br>
                        <b>Binary</b> - These operators act on two operands known as left and right.<br>
                        <b>Ternary</b> - These operators act on three operands.
                    </p>
