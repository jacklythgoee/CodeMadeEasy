                        A <b>statement</b> is a type of instruction that causes the program to perform some action. Statements are often terminated by a semicolon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A <b>function</b> is a collection of statements that execute sequentially. Every C++ program must include a 
                        special function named main. When you run your program, execution starts at the top of the main function.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A function is also a reusable sequence of statements designed to do a particular job 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A syntax error occurs when you violate the grammatical rules of the written language
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Comments allow the programmer to leave notes in the code. Most languages will allow two methods (Single, multiline)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Data is any sequency of symbols that can be interpreted to mean something. A single piece of data, stored somewhere in memory is called a value.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A variable is a named piece of memory that we can use to store values. A variableâ€™s name is called an <b>identifier</b>. 
                        In order to create a variable, we use a statement called a <b>definition statement</b>. When the program is run, each defined variable 
                        is <b>instantiated</b>, which means it is assigned a memory address.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A <b>data type</b> tells the compiler how to interpret a piece of data into a meaningful value. An integer is a number that can be written without a 
                        fractional component, such as 4, 27, 0, -2, or -12.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Copy assignment</b> (via operator=) can be used to assign an already created variable a value.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Initialization can be used to give a variable a value at the point of creation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>std::cout</b> and operator<< allow us to output an expression to the console as text. std::endl outputs a new line character, forcing the console cursor to move to the next line.<br>
                        <b>std::cin</b> and operator>> allow us to get a value from the keyboard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        C++ reserves a set of names called <b>keywords</b>. These have special meaning within the language and may not be used as variable names.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A literal constant is a fixed value inserted directly into the source code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An <b>operation</b> is a mathematical calculation involving zero or more input values, called <b>operands</b>. The specific operation to be performed is denoted by 
                        the provided <b>operator</b>. The result of an operation produces an output value.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Unary</b> operators take one operand. <b>Binary</b> operators take two operands, often called left and right. 
                        <b>Ternary</b> operators take three operands.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An <b>expression</b> is a combination of literals, variables, operators, and function calls that are evaluated to
                        produce a single output value. The calculation of this output value is called <b>evaluation</b>. The value produced is the 
                        <b>result</b> of the expression.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An <b>expression statement</b> is an expression that has been turned into a statement by placing a semicolon at the end of the expression.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A for loop is used to repeat a specific block of code a known number of times.

                            Initialization provides a variable with an initial value (at the point of creation). 
                            Assignment gives a variable a new value after the variable has already been defined.
